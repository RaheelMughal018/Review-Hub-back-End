Review
"For this price this is a solid mouse. It is super lightweight and glides without much drag. It has 6 DPI presets (1200, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4800 and 7200) so out of the box it will not go up to 12800 DPI, to customize these presets you will need to download the software from the Kemove website (just click ""Drivers"" at the top and select ""Software"", then scroll down and find TMKB M1SE). The software also allows you to select from a pre-defined list of functions that you can reprogram each button to. You can change DPI presets and change the RGB lighting modes using either the software or you can use button combinations on the mouse itself to do this as well so you can get away with using this mouse just fine without any issues if you don't want to install the software as it's not entirely necessary. Would definitely pick up another one of these in the future. If you want something cheap that you don't have to worry about recharging the battery for, this is a solid option.

"Does everything you need if to, for cheap!  Has held up to heavy use, has a scroll speed adjuster built in, several extra buttons that can be keybinded in games for QOL, and pretty much everything you would expect in a much higher priced mouse.  Can't go wrong with this purchase.

"When I'm gaming, my hands tend to get quite sweaty, and this mouse holds the sweat on the LMB and the RMB as well as the middle of the mouse. Thought this would be a ripoff but it is surprisingly nice. RGB is awesome, matching my LED lights and glides well. Lots of DPI settings, though I recommend the lower ones. Overall, insane mouse for the money.

"After going through not one, but two, G502 mice, I sat down with my daughter to get something different; I wasn’t going through anymore mouse-click issues. I asked her one question before I started our search: “What’s the one thing (stupid clicking fail not included) you would change about this mouse?”Her response, it didn’t thrill us, thought she’d say it’s too large and she’d need hands as large as gorillas, but she went a direction I never consida’d: “I don’t like how it makes my hand sweat,” she replied. Interesting.Came across this mouse and it ticked all of the boxes. A few weeks later and it’s just as effective now as it was the day she received it. Her hand never sweats now, the mouse actually clicks when it is supposed to, and it matches her desk setup well.The DPI is legit, the honeycomb shell she absolutely loves, and the smaller form factor from that of the G502 is an added bonus for her. Bloxburg, Skyrim, Fortnite, Spider-Man, the latest Avatar (something Frontier, maybe?), and Hogwart’s Legacy all run remarkable and feel far more responsive to her. Not only that, I don’t get bothered 25 times a day because the mouse is “stupid clicking”. The Logitech G502 is gone. And she is thrilled with this purchase. We can’t attest to the LED setup since she likes to keep it flashing as-is, so I’m unable to cover the ease of use or durability of the setup that requires, but she loves it and it is serving her flawlessly. I’ll update if that changes, but it is far past the point where the G502 models had already failed and started the fabled clicking fail from snail mail. *shrug*Gaming performance for my little girl. This father is pleased.

"I for real don't wanna sound like a fake review but I got this a few hours ago and I play a lot of Fortnite and do content creation. I started using this and it's crazy good. You have roughly 5-6 dpi settings maybe 1-2 more I haven't counted and I it has different color codes for the setting. The button can be found on the top under the scroll wheel and in between the left and right click. If you want to change the rgb mode then you press the dpi and back side button and the same time. To change the color it's the front one (the one closest to the top of the mouse) and press that and the dpi button at the same time. I would have rather it had a button separately on the bottom to change the mode/color but it's whatever I'll get it down soon. Such a great budget mouse for $20 I got it for $15 because it was on sale but still all in all a great mouse for the price and could compete with high end 50-60 dollar mice the only thing that would be cool to see tmkb to do is make a wireless model for like 25-30 dollars

     I’m just getting into PC gaming and needed a mouse that wasn’t going to break the bank. This one caught my eye because it looked lighter than my other option I was contemplating on. I chose this one and couldn’t be happier! The RGB is bright and It’s super comfortable in the hand (I don’t have big hands and some mice just don’t work for me.) the buttons aren’t too flimsy and don’t get in your way at all. I definitely recommend this item to anyone :)

"Went from a razer deathadder that I absolutely hated. This mouse is light, feels great and has multiple DPI settings. RGB looks good too. Would buy again

"Ich hab mir diese Maus besorgt, da meine andere Maus leider kaputtging. Für den Preis kann man natürlich nicht das beste erwarten, jedoch ist diese Maus sehr gut um Spiele zu spielen. Das ändern der RGB-Farben ist sehr leicht durch die App und die Maus reagiert auch perfekt ohne Verzögerungen, weshalb es von mir 5 Sterne gibt.
