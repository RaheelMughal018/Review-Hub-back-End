#charge for paper bags üò°
What are the behaviors of all such brands like Sapphire  Khaadi Crossstitch.pk Limelight  and other brands. we pay high amount of bill they infact charged us all huge taxes but no such paper bag provide to us  üõç  Means we go other place to carry all stuff in hand..
Dear all fellows Kindly take serious action against this üôÑüò° if they are in the line of cost cutting so why we pay for bag? #Boycott

Beautiful colours and colours combination
Hey! Thank you for your lovely feedback. Hope to keep delighting you in the future.
"Khadi bags are useful for car trips also, especially with kids. Keep throwing random kid stuff in it used by the kids so you don‚Äôt lose that stuff. üòÇ"
The only drawback is that it doesn‚Äôt have a zipper. I‚Äôd say charge 50 rs more but add a zipper
Memon Reema love the zip idea üí°
But they should not write their brand name if we are paying for the bag
Nadia Shamim well if you are paying 200 or plus then Consider it as a product
i will share my experience. theres a local departmental store here in my area who charge for bags. once i forgot to take my own bags. the bill was paid via card. after charging the amount he asked madam apko bag b chahye tha. i said ji chahye. he said oho me ne bill kar dia hay ap cash day dain 30. i said i dont have any cash with me. guess what. he took out a shiny plastic bag hidden under the billing counter. those free ones we used to get. so i said bhai zara do aur nikal dain alag alag dalain chezain jis tarah alag alag bags k charge kar k ap alag alag pack kartay hain. and he did that without a word.
Naila Aman are you talking about imtiaz? because they did not even bother to hide the shoppers. rather they were hanging right next to the counter. i too asked the person on duty if we can just keep the stuff in it than purchasing another bag. he refused and spoke gibberishüòÇ couldn‚Äôt understand what he said lol
Kashaf Amjad not imtiaz. it was Rahim Store
There are some selected clothes that comes with a fabric bag on khaadi. You can check that online too.
"I got my order two days ago from khaadi, it came in plastic bag."
Ye dresses ka fabric kaise hy I saw it on website they are offering low price are they worth buying?.
Syed Hammad Ali Bukhari plz bataye kapra to Pura hai nah ?
"Mariya Akbar naah they have 2 qualities, one in for 200 (pictured one) and other one is somewhere around 600"
Sapphire has been giving cloth bags FOC for every order
Paper bags comes from trees .. for that they have to cut trees. First everyone stopped paper bags because they were not environment friendly. Now again shifting to paper bags because that is environment friendly.. its all a hoax of the capitalist world.. treating us like pawns in their greed for more expenditure. Sab milke hum ko ulo bana rahe hain.
So abroad you pay so that you know that next time you go somewhere you take the same bag.. the entire point of paying for extra shopping bag is to reuse and abuse
i bought some suits from khaadi few months back. they gave me a paper bag and charged me for that bag but on our way to our car tha bag broke and all the suits were on road. i dont know why are they doing this and how much more money they will earn from this garbage bag.
You‚Äôre right recently I ordered from khaddi and got it delivered with cloth bag instead of plastic bag. And when I ordered from al karam they delivered in plastic bag
Firstly Limelight interduce these bags
What are they charging for this carry bag
Hammad Asghar put this as illustration in my dissertation
Simply .. Khaadi has started doing business using the useless rags üòÜ
That‚Äôs the trend that should be followed if we really wanna reduce use of plastic.. ub wo khaadi ho ya koi bh brand..
kababjees also giving cloth bags for cakes
"Then just take a paper bag of your choice, or an thaila that you fancy."
"Do them one better. Take Nishat's bag to Khaadi, take Khaadi's bag to Nishat, take J.'s bag to Sapphire and vice versa. Too much fun ü§ò"
"I see people saying ""If you are paying for a suit at khaadi then why are they branding it?"""
"Wrong! Khadi sells suits, it is not a shopping bags selling store. Customers should have the option of buying the 10 rupees non branded bags imo."
Take your own bag and dont pay for Khaadi bags. Simple.
Its happening poori dunya mai I guess
This happens everywhere in the world
I have seen worst quality bags than Khaadi being sold by brands and local shops. It is a way to stop wastage and maybe make some extra money on the side!
You can bring or purchase your own white bag and put your purchased items in that... There is nothing wrong in charging for the bags whether they are branded or non branded
Carrefour also charges for their bags
"The purpose of charging for the bags is to reduce waste. They‚Äôre selling cloth bags for 200 pkr so you can either get those or carry your own cloth bag next time you shop at Khaadi. Same as carrefour and miniso etc. You either buy a reusable cloth bag that‚Äôll last you months or any other cloth, paper or plastic bag from any brand honestly that you can use to save money and the environment!"
"You are buying it from their shop, if you don‚Äôt want to roam with a logo then bring your own paper bags and get over it as soon as possible"
Daily some one cries on bags as if no other issue is left on planet .
Why its so difficult to bring your own bag when going to khaadi ?
"I take my bag along .. Khaadi or whatever shop, i NEVER PAY be it 10 or100 for a printed or a plain bag."
"Don't buy it, apna bag ghr se le k jayenü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Like they are not forcing you to buy a bag. The same way they have khaadi written on their suits displayed in their outlets and its your choice buy them or not.
"So the idea is to discourage people from buying bags to reduce paper waste. And considering the current load on our landfills, I don't think there's anything wrong with it."
"Also, they always ask at the counter if you want the bag to be added to the bill."
"If anyone doesn't want to pay for the bag with Khaadi""s logo, don't buy it. Take your bag with you. Or if you've shopped from another brand , use their bag instead."
It‚Äôs 50 for paper bag and for printed 150 in Islamabad.
Pakistani brands jahan se paisey Kama saktey hain kama rae hain .
"I have seen multiple posts regarding paid bags in Pakistan. Mere Bhai, I have visited Europe, majoity brands either fashion store or Cash and carry charge for the bags and they charge for their own #branded bags and nobody ever complained there. They are happy to pay 10-20 cents for the branded bag. We are happy to buy the ""branded wallet and bags"" in thousands but unable to pay for a shopping bag of few cents."
Khaadi needs to focus on their fabric quality instead of doing nonsense harkaten!
"You were paying for it before as well, packaging cost is always added as a overhead while costing."
Maybe they excluded that and made it optional for people to buy or not buy the bags?
Seriously who is letting this same issue being dragged for no good reason. If you have issue take bags from home and understand it‚Äôs their commodity they are selling their commodity they can put anything on it. They are giving you option to buy or not to buy.
This group needs to change their names to whines of customer.
Dear admin pls put up a pinned post saying
Don't like how the business operates don't buy from them period
"Paying for these bags dosen't make sense. Khaddi should keep bio degradable bags, that is worth paying for and also serves the purpose to keep environment clean."
Agreed. That is why i dont take publicity bags. Why should i market their brand for free.
"Indeed, I am in 101% agreement. They have to give it for free, even subsidies you for doing marketing for them"
"Take ur own cloth bag,reusable. Ppl all over the world do it. It's green and Davis nature. Start recy owing in pak,we need it so much. N y pay huge amounts to these brands for THELAS"
I don't mind paying for a bag. But I don't like the idea of paying for marketing their brand.
Sigh‚Ä¶not a day goes by we don‚Äôt get a post like this on this forum
"True that ! That's why I stopped them immediately when they want to add shopping bag in the bill. When I as a customer paying for it I have every right to use it several times without being brand ambassador that too ""UNPAID ONE"" for later usage of the bag."
It's just a sustainable movement where people are motivated to use reusable bag instead of buying a new bag everytime. In Scandinavia we're paying for bags for basic groceries too.
Ok charge for bag but remove your logo and name from the bag Khaadi
"Agreed, refuse to take it, use your own shopper bagüòÑ tell them we don't want to pay for ur bag, if they insist then ask them to give it free, raise voice for ur rights, sirf idhar post daal kr koi faida nahi, ta phir khamoshi se pay karein"
Oh my god all these people‚Ä¶. Bhaie sahab take ur own bag.
Or maybe read about why brands and companies are doing it. Climate change suna hai? GET ON WITH THE PROGRAM!
I agree to it.. why should pay for their bags and advertise their brand.. why should we pay for the bag with their brand name.. if they want to make money out of paper bags then these bags should not have their logo .. otherwise we should boycott buying these bags and we should bring own bag at such outlets.. it's not about paying 50 or 100 RS but agar hum isse tarah in chotay chotay isse ko nazar andaaz kartay rahienge to yeh brands isse tarah hamien loottay rahienge ..
I don‚Äôt see the logic of such paper waste concept at all. Because if someone buying lot of stuff they will of-course pay for the bags too. Status conscious Ab bag bhi buy karke showoff karenge üòÇ
Bring change by zero paper bag policy. Period.
Whats wrong in taking your own bag with you ...
"I really like this approach of charged paper bags, so, people will consider taking their own"
"There is a cost of every expenditure, they cld have increased prices by 100 and u wldnt even notice‚Ä¶ this way uve got a choice to save rs 100 !"
Don't buy their bag next time.
Carry ur own bag in ur handbag.
Even this keep non branded bags or shopping bags those don't come free' u will have to pay for it too
Lol .. I do not understand this weird concept at all .. you roam around the world and buy whatever you wanna buy and none of the brand will charge you any additional cost for the shopping bag
"there is a reason why India stands where it is today, however in Pakistan like most people here defending Khaadi's act, feel proud to support the corrupt & corrupt practices."
Charging consumers for carry-bags is illegal
Charging consumers for carry-bags is illegal
Please start carrying your own cloth bags
Stop buying these bags from them
They are a business and can sell anything on their shop.
Carry your own bag or carry another brand's bag. Also ask them to keep plain bags. We shouldn't be paying for their advertisements. They are getting business from us and also charging us for their advertisements. Amazing!
"I think that's totally fine ..in Germany & other countries they also charge for the bags (not all brands) , even in supermarkets they charge 20 or 50 cents."
why are they giving their suits in plactic bags? They should stop that too or start charging those as well. Then we will take out the item from their printed plastic bag and put it in our own bag.
"I wouldn‚Äôt think too much abt this, now that I am seeing another post on a similar issue.They are charging for the cost of the bag and I don‚Äôt always put Khaadi stuff when reusing it. It‚Äôs very subjective and petty."
Yeah so accurate why we pay them the cost for the bag? That is something which is totally wrong khaddi is just trying to pull out money from the Pocket of customers in any form.
Agreed.printed bags are good to reuse but with khaadi logo it can't be...
U can take your own bag.. simple.. obv they will promote their own brand... no brainer
not only khaadi but every other brand doing this. i went to NDure n they are also charging for their logo bag
Same post again and again ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è..
Don't want to advertise their brand by carrying their logo? Bring your own. Because it is what it is! Kia karain ab?
Bhai poori dunya is trying to go into reduce reuse recycle for this earth to be able to house the crazy amount of humans crawling it - in a healthy way.
Brands are joining in on the trend of charging for the bags to discourage the use of bags needlessly all the time and thats the least they can do now as brands cz factoriyan tou nai band kar sakte as people like us LIKE to shop from them. DEMAND
"Its very basic - charging for bags to reduce use and encourage reuse - why should they make bags on their pocket and not even print a logo of their own on it, while the clothes that would be carried in that bag are from that shop. Muft ke nai bantay bag chahay paper ke hon , kapray ke ya biodegradable plastic ke."
"Pakistan main koi achai ki taraf barhta hai tou uska saath den ., mat khareeden bag apna lijayen - na koi lega na wo banayen ge - sab ka faida!"
I paid 200 for a printed fabric bag in the package mall branch.
Its irrelevant to charge .. i wonder why they have started so .. everything is already been added under the cost of each commodity

Today we purchased a 7000 worth suite from sapphire and along with taxes they charged RS 30 extra for a paper bag although 30 rupees is just a penny but a customer who‚Äôs spending 7000  doesn‚Äôt deserve a paper bag? Even Layers gives 250 worth brownie in a paper bag Sapphire

Stitched dress or any kind of unstitched clothplz explain??
Hats off to you guys
Is there any measurement specifications
It is far much better to donate extra clothes to some needy persons rather than getting this 10 % discount.

Pathetic I placed order and haven't received any mail or msg üòï
"Sapphire i ordered 2 dresses, in one dress dupatta sent to me is of linen fabric instead of khaddar what is this behavior, and quality of khaddar is so bad"

Why khaddi needs to promote their logo as its already a famous brand all over ..but this act of khaddi might bring down their name in clothing n home accessories!!‚úåüèΩ
This is great. I am very happy. I literally have to fight with staff at my grocery store as I always bring my own recyclable bags and they want to use their own plastic bags so they can seal them.
Next we will ask gucci and lv to remove their logos from bags and shoes.
Not sure what's more amusing- the ignorant take or the number of people agreeing to it.
I denied buying these at Imtiaz too üòõ
Next time ask for a suit at khaadi with out the logo/label of khaadi
As all of khaadi products have label on it with khaadi printed
If you are paying for a suit at khaadi then why are they branding it?
If you can't pay then you must bring your bag from home.
We have always been paying to hyperstar and carrefor and then all the bakeries for their logo branded bags now why not for khadi
Majority brands are doing same thing.
"Why people compare Pakistan with other countries! UK mai itny ka bag hy, US mai itny ka!! You can‚Äôt compare UK US currency and life style with Pak. Thank you to people saying carry reusable bag."
"Whenever you do to Khaadi for shopping, take a bag of Gul Ahmed or Bonanza or any other brand with you üòÑ, put Khaadi clothes in it and feel the revenge üòâ"
But this happens everywhere. Its a customer choice. They can leave it or take it. Simple
"I always try not to be offensive to anyone, but zain sb, you really need to get a life."
Why shouldnt they sell branded bagS? Unka brand unka bag.
Aap nay bag nahi khareedna na khareedain bhaiü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they are not forcing you.
Buy your kurta and hand carry it
will u ask them to remove their tags from those hefty cost kurtas u r buying ?
Customer ko bags free of cost provide krne chaiye where is customer care ?
Absolutely right we are already paying too much for the clothes
They ask before billing whether you want their bag or not.
"My only concern is, that you are charging for bags which are still paper? Is it recycled material? Why not use cloth bags then and charge for that?"
Yeah same. Like chaseup charge for their brown bag & we've no issue bcz it's simple brown bag with no publicity of them & we can carry it anywhere needed.
Brands are claiming this is govt policy. Is this so ??
"I just don‚Äôt understand how people have so much time to whine about non issues and the amount of stupid, repentant and useless posts I see here just makes me think how stupid we are as a nation."
Khaadi bags are their own product which they‚Äôre selling. All the brands in world do the same. Tomorrow you‚Äôll say Pepsi shouldn‚Äôt advertise their name on their drinks‚Ä¶ like seriously?
"Here in UK, Tesco, Lidl, Asda and Aldi sell bags with their brand name on it. It‚Äôs their bags and they‚Äôre selling it as a product what‚Äôs so different to understand in this?"
I am so going to get my own bags now
Kaun har dukaan P√© shoppers ka pay kare
And y would I pay 30 rs for a bag in the first place
No other brands charge 4 bags...
Whenever go for shopping take a bag with you. Easy solution
"It's a problem if they force you to buy the bag, you always have the option to bring your own bag. This happens literally everywhere in the world"
Agreed... Its better to bring shopper or shopping bag from home.
Then stop buying the bag get yourself a good bag and always take that with you... If you are so ashamed to carry then you can always pay for the bag

"If they have the logo on and are charging for the bag, it's illegal. Everyone's been doing it, be it some grocery store or a clothing brand."
"100% agree, and Bata shoes doing the same. They charge 10 PKR, and they don't even inform you."
These red bags were free 7 years back we use to take extra when we shopped at khaadi
200 rs/ for printed bags
They are also offering rs. 300 tote bag which you can carry with yourself every-time you go for shopping. And they look beautiful too.
"They hv that much margin to gv atleat a bag to customer as a gift, not 100 wala But a 30 wala,aik bag mai 2 dresses ajaty hain"
Those are the times when ppl ask each bag for each dress and they use to give Happily
They're charging for bags so you can take your own bag.
This is too small an issue to be talked about.
"Following the footsteps of the apple brand, I can see the era where back and front of the shirt will be sold differently."
Agreed to your point. Brands doing marketing and we are paying for it..
Carry your own bag ü•∞
Don't take their beg simple
They should give cloth bag
"I am also sueing Apple company to remove their logo from the phone. I mean, are they stupid or something? Why put their logos on boxes and other accessories?"
Main kal hi California Nikal Rahi Hun Dharney k liye. üòä
now I know that some shamoon sultan owns KHAADI üò¨
Charge for the bag.. remove the logo..
Have not been charged yet
But i promise i will literally give the bag and keep my dresses in my hands:p just to let them know k bhaai hum manage kr lenge .. tu rakh shopper sara hua apne pass
Keep a cloth bag with u everytime u go out.
I keep bags in my car for grocery and a sapphire cloth bag in my hand bag for other items.
Sapphire gives cloth bags free
The kapra bag is for 200 rupees
I didn pay for the bag üí∞ lol
"you should raise your voice against all brands like car companies that they should no mention their name as your paying, All things you purchase should not have any brand name as your paying or if they use brand name they should give you free"
Take ur own bag frm home
Its better take your own bag
Don't give them profits by purchasing or stop whining.
Shamoon sultan ko ab hair transplant karwana hy isilye he is charging this much for branded bags
Accurate. Paying for advertising lol
Start bringing along ur own bags....
Good post we will Carry out own
I'll carry Imteyaz store bags next time
Agreed to every bit of this post
Simply carry ur own shopping bag
Another way to green wash.
I agree with you and others opposing your genuinely raised point are fools
im just sick of the posts
Why should I give them publicity
I second you. I hate paying for the bag but would love to spend thousands on the shopping. Similarly we all hate paying for the delivery charges. üòÑ
"I call it a bad service/ no customer-brand relationship, if they charge for the bag. Brand is running for years but they don't know what customers like and what don't. Pathetic."
You ... Literally Are Paying For Their Branded Clothing ... Why Would You Do That ?
to stop this shoper selling culture.
keep an alternative brand bag in pocket and use that to stop from the alternative brand store.
these bags dont even cost 10 RS in bulk store can easily adjust it under their profit % age
Businesses cannot charge for carry bags with their names and logos printed on them; it is better to bring your own bag.
Chase up is selling plain bags for50 hence Thier bags are worth buying (can hold 25kg plus wieght)
For gods sake..in the uk Asda bags are 10p tesco bags are 10 p and guess what. It's got their logo on it. So what?

"When we are charged for a Victoria‚Äôs Secret bag abroad, there are no complains. Miniso has been charging people for bags since start but khaadi nay kr liya to masla hay. It‚Äôs An international brand if you‚Äôve issues, don‚Äôt buy from them simple. But this practice isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary"
If you don't want logo bag go for simple bag. May be someone would be interested in their logo bags for gift purposes
"Do them one better. Take Nishat's bag to Khaadi, take Khaadi's bag to Nishat, take J.'s bag to Sapphire and vice versa. Too much fun ü§ò"
"I see people saying ""If you are paying for a suit at khaadi then why are they branding it?"""
"Wrong! Khadi sells suits, it is not a shopping bags selling store. Customers should have the option of buying the 10 rupees non branded bags imo."
Take your own bag and dont pay for Khaadi bags. Simple.
Its happening poori dunya mai I guess
This happens everywhere in the world
I have seen worst quality bags than Khaadi being sold by brands and local shops. It is a way to stop wastage and maybe make some extra money on the side!
You can bring or purchase your own white bag and put your purchased items in that... There is nothing wrong in charging for the bags whether they are branded or non branded
Carrefour also charges for their bags
"The purpose of charging for the bags is to reduce waste. They‚Äôre selling cloth bags for 200 pkr so you can either get those or carry your own cloth bag next time you shop at Khaadi. Same as carrefour and miniso etc. You either buy a reusable cloth bag that‚Äôll last you months or any other cloth, paper or plastic bag from any brand honestly that you can use to save money and the environment!"
"You are buying it from their shop, if you don‚Äôt want to roam with a logo then bring your own paper bags and get over it as soon as possible"
Daily some one cries on bags as if no other issue is left on planet .
Why its so difficult to bring your own bag when going to khaadi ?
"I take my bag along .. Khaadi or whatever shop, i NEVER PAY be it 10 or100 for a printed or a plain bag."
"Don't buy it, apna bag ghr se le k jayenü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Like they are not forcing you to buy a bag. The same way they have khaadi written on their suits displayed in their outlets and its your choice buy them or not.
"So the idea is to discourage people from buying bags to reduce paper waste. And considering the current load on our landfills, I don't think there's anything wrong with it."
"Also, they always ask at the counter if you want the bag to be added to the bill."
"If anyone doesn't want to pay for the bag with Khaadi""s logo, don't buy it. Take your bag with you. Or if you've shopped from another brand , use their bag instead."
It‚Äôs 50 for paper bag and for printed 150 in Islamabad.
Pakistani brands jahan se paisey Kama saktey hain kama rae hain .
"I have seen multiple posts regarding paid bags in Pakistan. Mere Bhai, I have visited Europe, majoity brands either fashion store or Cash and carry charge for the bags and they charge for their own #branded bags and nobody ever complained there. They are happy to pay 10-20 cents for the branded bag. We are happy to buy the ""branded wallet and bags"" in thousands but unable to pay for a shopping bag of few cents."
Khaadi needs to focus on their fabric quality instead of doing nonsense harkaten!
"You were paying for it before as well, packaging cost is always added as a overhead while costing."
Maybe they excluded that and made it optional for people to buy or not buy the bags?
Seriously who is letting this same issue being dragged for no good reason. If you have issue take bags from home and understand it‚Äôs their commodity they are selling their commodity they can put anything on it. They are giving you option to buy or not to buy.
This group needs to change their names to whines of customer.
Dear admin pls put up a pinned post saying
Don't like how the business operates don't buy from them period
"Paying for these bags dosen't make sense. Khaddi should keep bio degradable bags, that is worth paying for and also serves the purpose to keep environment clean."
Agreed. That is why i dont take publicity bags. Why should i market their brand for free.
"Indeed, I am in 101% agreement. They have to give it for free, even subsidies you for doing marketing for them"
"Take ur own cloth bag,reusable. Ppl all over the world do it. It's green and Davis nature. Start recy owing in pak,we need it so much. N y pay huge amounts to these brands for THELAS"
I don't mind paying for a bag. But I don't like the idea of paying for marketing their brand.
Sigh‚Ä¶not a day goes by we don‚Äôt get a post like this on this forum
"True that ! That's why I stopped them immediately when they want to add shopping bag in the bill. When I as a customer paying for it I have every right to use it several times without being brand ambassador that too ""UNPAID ONE"" for later usage of the bag."
It's just a sustainable movement where people are motivated to use reusable bag instead of buying a new bag everytime. In Scandinavia we're paying for bags for basic groceries too.
Ok charge for bag but remove your logo and name from the bag Khaadi
"Agreed, refuse to take it, use your own shopper bagüòÑ tell them we don't want to pay for ur bag, if they insist then ask them to give it free, raise voice for ur rights, sirf idhar post daal kr koi faida nahi, ta phir khamoshi se pay karein"
Oh my god all these people‚Ä¶. Bhaie sahab take ur own bag.
Or maybe read about why brands and companies are doing it. Climate change suna hai? GET ON WITH THE PROGRAM!
I agree to it.. why should pay for their bags and advertise their brand.. why should we pay for the bag with their brand name.. if they want to make money out of paper bags then these bags should not have their logo .. otherwise we should boycott buying these bags and we should bring own bag at such outlets.. it's not about paying 50 or 100 RS but agar hum isse tarah in chotay chotay isse ko nazar andaaz kartay rahienge to yeh brands isse tarah hamien loottay rahienge ..
I don‚Äôt see the logic of such paper waste concept at all. Because if someone buying lot of stuff they will of-course pay for the bags too. Status conscious Ab bag bhi buy karke showoff karenge üòÇ
Bring change by zero paper bag policy. Period.
Whats wrong in taking your own bag with you ...
"I really like this approach of charged paper bags, so, people will consider taking their own"
"There is a cost of every expenditure, they cld have increased prices by 100 and u wldnt even notice‚Ä¶ this way uve got a choice to save rs 100 !"
Don't buy their bag next time.
Carry ur own bag in ur handbag.
Even this keep non branded bags or shopping bags those don't come free' u will have to pay for it too
Lol .. I do not understand this weird concept at all .. you roam around the world and buy whatever you wanna buy and none of the brand will charge you any additional cost for the shopping bag
"there is a reason why India stands where it is today, however in Pakistan like most people here defending Khaadi's act, feel proud to support the corrupt & corrupt practices."
Charging consumers for carry-bags is illegal
Charging consumers for carry-bags is illegal
Please start carrying your own cloth bags
Stop buying these bags from them
They are a business and can sell anything on their shop.
Carry your own bag or carry another brand's bag. Also ask them to keep plain bags. We shouldn't be paying for their advertisements. They are getting business from us and also charging us for their advertisements. Amazing!
"I think that's totally fine ..in Germany & other countries they also charge for the bags (not all brands) , even in supermarkets they charge 20 or 50 cents."
why are they giving their suits in plactic bags? They should stop that too or start charging those as well. Then we will take out the item from their printed plastic bag and put it in our own bag.
"I wouldn‚Äôt think too much abt this, now that I am seeing another post on a similar issue.They are charging for the cost of the bag and I don‚Äôt always put Khaadi stuff when reusing it. It‚Äôs very subjective and petty."
Yeah so accurate why we pay them the cost for the bag? That is something which is totally wrong khaddi is just trying to pull out money from the Pocket of customers in any form.
Agreed.printed bags are good to reuse but with khaadi logo it can't be...
U can take your own bag.. simple.. obv they will promote their own brand... no brainer
not only khaadi but every other brand doing this. i went to NDure n they are also charging for their logo bag
Same post again and again ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è..
Don't want to advertise their brand by carrying their logo? Bring your own. Because it is what it is! Kia karain ab?
Bhai poori dunya is trying to go into reduce reuse recycle for this earth to be able to house the crazy amount of humans crawling it - in a healthy way.
Brands are joining in on the trend of charging for the bags to discourage the use of bags needlessly all the time and thats the least they can do now as brands cz factoriyan tou nai band kar sakte as people like us LIKE to shop from them. DEMAND
"Its very basic - charging for bags to reduce use and encourage reuse - why should they make bags on their pocket and not even print a logo of their own on it, while the clothes that would be carried in that bag are from that shop. Muft ke nai bantay bag chahay paper ke hon , kapray ke ya biodegradable plastic ke."
"Pakistan main koi achai ki taraf barhta hai tou uska saath den ., mat khareeden bag apna lijayen - na koi lega na wo banayen ge - sab ka faida!"
I paid 200 for a printed fabric bag in the package mall branch.
Its irrelevant to charge .. i wonder why they have started so .. everything is already been added under the cost of each commodity
Why khaddi needs to promote their logo as its already a famous brand all over ..but this act of khaddi might bring down their name in clothing n home accessories!!‚úåüèΩ
This is great. I am very happy. I literally have to fight with staff at my grocery store as I always bring my own recyclable bags and they want to use their own plastic bags so they can seal them.
Next we will ask gucci and lv to remove their logos from bags and shoes.
Not sure what's more amusing- the ignorant take or the number of people agreeing to it.
I denied buying these at Imtiaz too üòõ
Next time ask for a suit at khaadi with out the logo/label of khaadi
As all of khaadi products have label on it with khaadi printed
If you are paying for a suit at khaadi then why are they branding it?
If you can't pay then you must bring your bag from home.
We have always been paying to hyperstar and carrefor and then all the bakeries for their logo branded bags now why not for khadi
Majority brands are doing same thing.
"Why people compare Pakistan with other countries! UK mai itny ka bag hy, US mai itny ka!! You can‚Äôt compare UK US currency and life style with Pak. Thank you to people saying carry reusable bag."
"Whenever you do to Khaadi for shopping, take a bag of Gul Ahmed or Bonanza or any other brand with you üòÑ, put Khaadi clothes in it and feel the revenge üòâ"
But this happens everywhere. Its a customer choice. They can leave it or take it. Simple
"I always try not to be offensive to anyone, but zain sb, you really need to get a life."
Why shouldnt they sell branded bagS? Unka brand unka bag.
Aap nay bag nahi khareedna na khareedain bhaiü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they are not forcing you.
Buy your kurta and hand carry it
will u ask them to remove their tags from those hefty cost kurtas u r buying ?
Customer ko bags free of cost provide krne chaiye where is customer care ?
Absolutely right we are already paying too much for the clothes
They ask before billing whether you want their bag or not.
"My only concern is, that you are charging for bags which are still paper? Is it recycled material? Why not use cloth bags then and charge for that?"
Yeah same. Like chaseup charge for their brown bag & we've no issue bcz it's simple brown bag with no publicity of them & we can carry it anywhere needed.
Brands are claiming this is govt policy. Is this so ??
"I just don‚Äôt understand how people have so much time to whine about non issues and the amount of stupid, repentant and useless posts I see here just makes me think how stupid we are as a nation."
Khaadi bags are their own product which they‚Äôre selling. All the brands in world do the same. Tomorrow you‚Äôll say Pepsi shouldn‚Äôt advertise their name on their drinks‚Ä¶ like seriously?
"Here in UK, Tesco, Lidl, Asda and Aldi sell bags with their brand name on it. It‚Äôs their bags and they‚Äôre selling it as a product what‚Äôs so different to understand in this?"
I am so going to get my own bags now
Kaun har dukaan P√© shoppers ka pay kare
And y would I pay 30 rs for a bag in the first place
No other brands charge 4 bags...
Whenever go for shopping take a bag with you. Easy solution
"It's a problem if they force you to buy the bag, you always have the option to bring your own bag. This happens literally everywhere in the world"
Agreed... Its better to bring shopper or shopping bag from home.
Then stop buying the bag get yourself a good bag and always take that with you... If you are so ashamed to carry then you can always pay for the bag

"If they have the logo on and are charging for the bag, it's illegal. Everyone's been doing it, be it some grocery store or a clothing brand."
"100% agree, and Bata shoes doing the same. They charge 10 PKR, and they don't even inform you."
These red bags were free 7 years back we use to take extra when we shopped at khaadi
200 rs/ for printed bags
They are also offering rs. 300 tote bag which you can carry with yourself every-time you go for shopping. And they look beautiful too.
"They hv that much margin to gv atleat a bag to customer as a gift, not 100 wala But a 30 wala,aik bag mai 2 dresses ajaty hain"
Those are the times when ppl ask each bag for each dress and they use to give Happily
They're charging for bags so you can take your own bag.
This is too small an issue to be talked about.
"Following the footsteps of the apple brand, I can see the era where back and front of the shirt will be sold differently."
Agreed to your point. Brands doing marketing and we are paying for it..
Carry your own bag ü•∞
Don't take their beg simple
They should give cloth bag
"I am also sueing Apple company to remove their logo from the phone. I mean, are they stupid or something? Why put their logos on boxes and other accessories?"

But i promise i will literally give the bag and keep my dresses in my hands:p just to let them know k bhaai hum manage kr lenge .. tu rakh shopper sara hua apne pass

I keep bags in my car for grocery and a sapphire cloth bag in my hand bag for other items.
Sapphire gives cloth bags free
The kapra bag is for 200 rupees
I didn pay for the bag üí∞ lol
"you should raise your voice against all brands like car companies that they should no mention their name as your paying, All things you purchase should not have any brand name as your paying or if they use brand name they should give you free"
Take ur own bag frm home
Its better take your own bag
Don't give them profits by purchasing or stop whining.
Shamoon sultan ko ab hair transplant karwana hy isilye he is charging this much for branded bags
Accurate. Paying for advertising lol
Start bringing along ur own bags....
Good post we will Carry out own
I'll carry Imteyaz store bags next time
Agreed to every bit of this post
Simply carry ur own shopping bag
Another way to green wash.
I agree with you and others opposing your genuinely raised point are fools
im just sick of the posts
Why should I give them publicity
I second you. I hate paying for the bag but would love to spend thousands on the shopping. Similarly we all hate paying for the delivery charges. üòÑ
"I call it a bad service/ no customer-brand relationship, if they charge for the bag. Brand is running for years but they don't know what customers like and what don't. Pathetic."

to stop this shoper selling culture.
keep an alternative brand bag in pocket and use that to stop from the alternative brand store.

If you don't want logo bag go for simple bag. May be someone would be interested in their logo bags for gift purposes
"Khaadi is now charging separately for just a paper bag. Not even any printed, cloth bag but a simple paper bag with their logo on it."
"Yes i understand that when we can buy a 3000 rs suit, we can definitely afford a 30rs bag but a huge brand like khaadi can atleast give them as complimentary. Would be a fair trade for customer service!"
Plus the quality is so so pathetic that those bags don't even support the weight of their products.
Is mulk k makenon k masly sun lo.
Matter of 30 rupes doesn‚Äôt demand this much attention.
Standard practice every where in the world... it is good that Pakistan is catching up with the world.
"Agreed that when we can buy 3000 suit, we can buy 30rs bag. But what about these brands? Cant they afford to give them complimentary? They are earning huge profits per piece!"
Yes i know internationally it is a common practice to charge for a bag but then those bags are cloth bags with great quality!
"Some posts here make me wonder if the name of the group should be 'cries of cry babies' ... sorry, but please get a life ..."
"Don't buy the bags then. Simple! How hard it is to take your own bags with you? Please know that it's a common practice around the world. The practice is done to discourage customers from buying bags, plastic or paper. Why can't we develop a habit? Stop complaining all the time. Her waqt bag ka rona. Mat lo yaar!"
"Stop expecting to get things for free, the world doesn't work that way."
These bags are torn into pieces as soon as one steps out from the shop .
I don't mind buying a 120 rupees shopping bag after doing thousands of shopping but this is absolutely insane ...
"Ok, we can pay for the bag too, but why are they putting their brand logo on it?"
What i do is take a bag of another brand like generation and use it in khaadi sarr bhe jate hain yeh aur sustainable bhe hai
Better to buy khaadi 200 cloth bag or carry any other cloth bag once shop and keep it with every market visit.
People around the world paying for the bags
This practise is usually to motivate recycle your bags
So next time people will remember to keep their own bags
THEY‚ÄôRE CALLED GREEN INITIATIVES! No one is trying to get you to ‚ÄúpAy FoR ThEiR mArkEtInG‚Äù - the idea is to encourage people to carry reusable bags and reduce wastefulness over all.
Everywhere in the world this happens. Remember to bring your own bag.
Every brand in world charges for bag
"Every brand is doing this shit, ideas , cross stitch , beechtree and every other brand doing this!"
Yesterday Hnm asked me to buy a bag also.
"And when i told him nobody charges for the bag. They said now our policy is changed since a month. And when i said i dont want it, he gave me a bag then without any charge. So its not only Pakistani stores doing this, its every freaking store is doing it"
"I never buy bags because as soon as we reach home, we throw them in the bin. So why waste money and a bag which you are not gonna use again?"
"I totally support ppl speaking up against brands and am totally against ppl who encourage corruption and malpractices, whether those are done across the world or no. Just bcs the world does something doesn't mean we should too no matter how pathetic it is"
It's just to discourage using shopping bags bc it's wastage of material. People should take bags from home or recycle plastic or paper bags.
When we can bear petrol and electricity bills then we can do anything.
Please take a bag in your purse next time. Simple hehe!
"Why not carry your own reusable bags when you go shopping. It's a common practice around the world to charge for bags to reduce waste. I make sure to carry reusable ones with me, they're sturdy, easy to carry and can hold a lot of items, plus I don't have to pay extra for bags. Change begins with us, why not adapt to change rather than whining about it. Especially if its for the betterment of our environment ‚úåÔ∏è"
Plus why we are paying for their branding?
If someone is charging for a bag then there shouldn‚Äôt be their logo!
It's not about 30 rupees.
It is about how We're cutting trees to make paper bags.
"If a customer is charged for 1 bag , he will think of using the same bag for more than 1 dress. Hence, you're helping save the environment."
"Which the customer might not value, if he gets free bags"
IDEAS also charges for paper bags
It's high time to boycott brands
We should support local businesses
"It's an international practice as I work here in the UK in Primark. The paper bags are always free and if you want to purchase a bag it's of a very good material kinda like kapra but it's called ""bag for life"". If that bag tears or what so ever you can return and get a new one for free. Ye nai hota ke brown paper bag ky charges ly koi because it's internationally free."
"All over the world, brands charge for the plastic bag...50cents to 2$... It's normal.. the reason behind this is to avoid the pollution and wastage...I don't know why in Pakistan ppl get so offended... 4000 ka suit le lain ge but won't pay for the bag..."
"This is to reduce plastic waste, practiced everywhere in the world. Carry your own cloth bag from home next time."
Yes this is wrong they are already charging too much for their products and now they are charging for paper bag too. . .why we buy these bags and with their logo on it . . .
Brands should realize that this is very easy and simple way of advertising to make ur good quality bags . . .
Make a habit of bringing your own bag everywhere.
Everywhere abroad they charge for bags. It is to encourage customers to reuse bags which reduces waste.
Its a standard practice everywhere in the world to reduce waste. Even if you buy bread and you need a bag. Its charged.
Same happened with Saphire too
I don't understand why we promote KHADI by buying extra 30 rs bag of its name tag .its better to take any shopper or handbag from home .
every brand doing the same and fabric quality is pathetic üòë
"Yeah , and we are doing free publicity of these brands by using their bags ."
Everyone is charging not only Khaadi
They charge it because they CAN charge it. They have built up the brand equity in such a way. They have paid the price for it in making Khaadi a strong brand. So either stop buying from them or just pay the damn 30rs.
Only if we stop purchasing bags. Its like paying for their own advertisements (logo on bags). We need to stop purchasing bags from them (hypermarkets and all such brands).
They should give clothe bags which are reusable
"I don‚Äôt disagree to buy, but why should we buy with their logo. I don‚Äôt want to pay them to advertise their brand."
"Next time I go, I‚Äôll take another brand‚Äôs bag and put Khaddi‚Äôs clothes in it!"
Buying bag is OK but then they cannot print their logo on it as we are not supposed to pay for their marketing. The bag should be plain then
Else they wud add 10 ruppes in cloth price
This practice is being followed all around the world generally to reduce waste and promote reuse.
Muhammad Ahmer highlight global warming here pls
"The sole purpose of banning plastic bags and shifting to cloth bags which you have to ‚Äòpay for‚Äô, was to discourage customers from getting new ones each time they shop. Those bags have to eventually go into the trash bins as soon as people reach home. So, to cut down on country‚Äôs garbage (which is a burden on the environment), start keeping cloth bags with you whenever you‚Äôre going out to shop. Reuse that same bag again and again. Don‚Äôt buy new bags from brands every time. Save your money and the environmentüå±"
Its standard practice around the globe - stop whining and take your own bag. Simple
Khaadi listening to this and decides to make the price ‚Äú3100‚Äù and Free Khaadi Bags.. ü´†
I miss the time when this was an issue for me.
Crazy in it. Stupid practice. The purpose was to discourage plastic bags hence the cost. And no- no one charges for paper bags in the UK.
Just another stupid fad picked up to bother us. Can‚Äôt get anything normal right.. like customer service.
"Brands only follow those practices that benefit them,poor customer service and quality stuff is the biggest issue but they don't bother to improve it....."
"Aur bhae if we r anyhow buying it, then give us a plain bag.. why do we have to pay for the bag havng ur own advertisement??"
That‚Äôs to encourage purchase of the cloth bag. Sustainable in the long run. A lot of shops abroad do the same
I also raised this issue.. n they say for environmental control we are doing thus.. if you have your own bag u cam bring it
This practice is usually to discourage customers from buying bags for the sake of our environment. If you have a problem buying bags everytime you shop then its a good thing that this strategy is working! Bring your own bag and reduce waste!!‚ôªÔ∏è
It‚Äôs illegal to sell bags with logos on them
"Sapphire did same! Ajeeb .. if we small businesses charge separately for a box or packaging, its going to be a never ending argument"
Unfortunately every brand is doing this they have made new business out of economy friendly project
Exactly the same thing happened at saphhire like a paper bag for 30rs and a really useless one
The point being-bring your own bags ... When will people ever get over this... !?
Every brand is charging now
Please dont use plastic/paper bags. Buy a recycleable cloth bag and reuse it.
Take dirty cloth bags with you
Every one start doing this
Not only khaddi ...miniso..sapphire and Almira they also charge for the bag quality is very low
They will get the salaries of the workers from this paper bag. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is now a standard practice all around the world...
Same is happening at Gul Ahmed
It's just 30rs de dou. Or else take your own bag!
Agreed... they easily got teared... they can instead introduce cloth bags that are reusable n light weight to carry
Alkaram atleast giving cloth bag in 10 rupees... I don't understand when we buy a 50 or 100 rupee item from a small shop.. they have courtesy to gave us a free shopper... but these big brands including CARREFOUR shamessly earning on shopping bags too from us for years... also the shoppers are with their brand names not the simple ones...
"Without dismissing your concern, my recommendatin is to carry a reusable tote bag with you. Folded like a spring roll, it hardly takes any space in your car/bag."
It‚Äôs a reminder to bring your own reusable bag. Every business that has its own bags is charging for it. As a reminder of the bring your own bags and don‚Äôt use plastic
"Take a generations bag next time, put on their counter and ask them to fill it up"
The least they can do is to give a reusable bag without a logo if they want to charge for it.
Now? It's been more than a year.
I've always loved khaadi because of their price range and fabric.
But now they are charging way too much. The 2pc dress used to cost 1800-2200.
Woh bhi ub 3k se km ka nhi hai.
"Secondly they are charging differently for dupatta, shirt and trouser. üòëüòë"
Gul ahmed also charge for bag
Even Beechtree started charging for these paper bags that cannot support the weight of their products
Not only in Pakistan. It seems to be common practice in Dubai and other countries.
It's a global initiative aimed at minimizing pollution. The idea is to encourage individuals to bring their own bags. Many developed countries and major brands charge for shopping bags as part of their commitment to environmental sustainability.
"Sapphire,limelight,bata,service also charge seprately for the 3rd class paper bag."
Some fraud people use name of khaddi...
To force u to remember to take a bag from home with you. It's the same law in the UK.
Make a DIY bag and carry tht..
Bhai 30 rs mjhsy lelo üò≠
"The way their customer service is declining, and prices are sky rocketing, it is very cheap of them. Brands that charge so high for their not so extra ordinary product should refrain from adding such unnecessary costs. These moves will only make them lose customers as people will soon start looking for alternatives."
"I already mentioned it in outlets too, a big brand all over the world n they charged 30 RSP after buying 8000/10,000 purchasing."
Exactly done at sapphire also
Same is beech tree doing...paper bag fr Rs.20...and most imp they dnt even ask u before charging...such a non sense
Why not carrying ur own bag for shopping? How difficult is it?
Every brand doing the same
Bata is also charging rs 30 for a paper bag
Its to introduce conscious use of shopping bags.
Stop taking that . Bycott this
We should promote old times bags to discourage extra bag charges. Keep your bag with u and get stuff.
"Ok since they are giving you a bag with their logo, you should demand compensation for advertising"
It's the common practice else where. Recently I went to a store and they adopted this change as well. Took the photo so that I can share it in VoC on such posts for motivation üòÄ
We have been using reusable bags for years now. Reduce waste and try to do your oart in solving pakistans waste management crisis.
Agar hmare pas bag hota hai to mai store k counter pe bag lene se mna krdeti hun.
"Khaadi sells fabric ahopping bags too, wo bhi do liye hue hain."
Take your own bag next time what we do hereüòÉno big brands give their shoppers free also here in Europe
Why? Take your own bag.
Khaadi has lost it's quality as well
Yup I bought something they didn't have shopper for free so I put in another brand one in front of them simple
What if you had responded like when the receptionist asked for the bag: Zahir hai hath mai tou leker jaongi nhiüòÖü§≠
I always keep a reusable cloth bag with me while shopping. Yesterday I bought a chappal from Bata and they asked same for the bag but I refused and kept my shoes in my cloth bag.Its always saving my 150-200 rupees which we spent on these so called brands bags.
"Gul Ahmed is doing the same shit! Move to sapphire, Crosstitch or saya they are much better these days in terms of customer service !"
Their salesman said they want people to be sustainable and stop using extra bag for every shopping.
That's why they're charging so that people bring that totes along.
Whether they but it or make one at home.
Not now they are practicing this since last year
Please carry your own bag. Simple!
U are right khaddi pwd Islamabad also charged
"We are so foolish people. By purchasing their bags with our own money, we advertise and promote Khaadi.."
"Was genuinely concerned for this innovation all brands are establishing but once I moved abroad, I realised that this is fair. Here you will see people coming on luxury cars with shopping bags in hands, even they keep them in their jackets, bags n cars so they don‚Äôt have to buy."
Khaadi apne marketing k paise bi customer se lera hai. Or yh consumer law k against hai. Customers can sue them.
Most major companies all of the world do this
It's actually a good practice introduced to encourage people to bring their own bags for shopping. Reduces wastage.
Not only khaadi alot of other brands are charging for it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Finally Pakistan is catching up.
Beech tree is also doing the same
Free advertising policy I also don't like that
After Israel products now boycott Pakistan brands and mention reason to improve their product and customer services.
Buy their 1 reusable bag of 100-150 & keep using it..
"....... when people will have to pay for a paper bag, they will prefer to carry their own reusable cloth bags when going shopping. Thus resulting in less paper being used, therefore, less trees being chopped down. The planet is running out of resources, get with the times."
"Exactly, this is the strange practice going on in our country. It should be free by default as a complementary gesture"
They are charging since ages. Not now
Bring your own bag while shopping simple
If they are charging for paper bags from customers they should sell simply paper bag with no khaddi name on it.
In Sweden and I think 95-99% of Europe they do it too. I bought 300 euro worth of house supplies from ikea and I had to pay for each of my 8 bags to hold my things so I can carry them on the bus. People do 1000 euro shopping here and still pay for the bags lol
They do not iron their products and the quality of products are no longer value for money...
To encourage you take your own bag along when you go out shopping.
"If they have to chrage me they need to give a plain bag, if it's their logo then why am I paying for their marketing?"
Beechtree is also selling paper bag
I've bought khaadi 2 PC for 3200 ..ü•∫
I avoid buying their bag rather hold their suit in my hand or bring bag from my home.
Stop going after such brands whose sole purpose is to earn money and money only and don't care about customers. But we are Pakistani's jaingay bhi aur phir bolaingay bhi
Buy a cloth bag and keep in your car.
Or just pay for the paper bag.
Thori mehnat Khud bhe kerlen.
"My god, there has to be such a post atleast once on this group"
"Pathetic practice. If the brand is so concerned about the environment, why not provide reusable bags and encourage that?"
"We pay for a paper bag (no sustainable materials), we advertise Khaadi‚Äôs logo for free, and the bag doesn‚Äôt even serve its purpose! It breaks on the way."
"Besides, their unstitched articles have tons of plastic."
"Carrying your own bag is good practice. But PEOPLE, let the customers speak! Express your opinions instead of mocking others. Why step on each other‚Äôs feet?"
We have to buy bags too here in Canada even if it‚Äôs a rich country so why can‚Äôt you in Pakistan üáµüá∞
Buy a cloth bag from them which is for 200 and bring that whenever you shop and it is reusable too
"Yes, hate that practice of Khaadi. Very stingy of them!"
In Canada u go to any grocery or shopping stores they charge u 4 a bag.
Better to carry your own bags.
only pakistani brands can do this. if there is logo on bag you can't sell it.
Everyone is charging. üòõ not only.khaadi
All big brands doing the same
"Boots do the same they charge 90rs for one and it‚Äôs shit quality too,Abroad they charge everywhere for paper bags."
No problem in paying 30 Rupees. It must be difficult for the company to keep track of thousands of bags everyday when sales staff can make many excuses for the lost bags.
It's a standard practice. And it's a good practice.
If they are charging for bag..they have no right to print their logo
Yeh mulk sirf aik cheez mein number one hai and this is 2 numbri that is all.
Many brands are doing the same unfortunately!
Almost every brand charged for bags.
They r trying to cut back on the use of paper (cutting trees etc) pls bring ur own bags
Har brand he charge kr rahaa
these paper bags are uselese and not less than raddi
they are charging taxes separetly as well
You should carry your own shoping bag while shoping instead taking from them.
Why paying for the bag when there is already a branding on it? You are doing YOUR promotion on OUR money.
Stop buying from brands who charge for bags. It must be okay and happening in the rest of the world but this is incorrect. Why would I buy a bag and roam around and market your brand by paying?! Thank God Generations is not doing it otherwise bht he limited options reh jaty
@Bata is also charging separately for a paper bag üò° Now we have to pay for their paper bags too
Totally agreed with the post
Gul Ahmed ideas also charging for bags
Lol they run big acs and spend a lot on their ambience and yet charge 30 rs for bags...thats funny
We should also boycott this kind of stupid brands
Most of the international brands charge for the bags with their logo on it! And ppl take their own bag along with them or pay for their bag.. it is a practice to save the paper bags ‚Ä¶
Zara charges world over even for paper bags to discourage use of bags and encourage customers to bring own bags‚Ä¶
Not only khaadi .. others brands too . I bought a dress from beechtree they did the same thing.
It is the worldwide policy customers should check before visiting for the first time.
Why ??? Come abroad and ull feel ashamed of even getting a bag ppl here carry reuseable bags to cut down on single plastic use. High end brands give bags fr free and paper bags are not even long lastiing eventually will go in the sea . We are the citizens of the world .. if not us who is going to look after this world? Small steps taken individually can play a huge role .
Customer should stop accepting and paying for these bags. Once we will buy a dress though it is 10k or 3k and infront of them put it into your hand carry/bag they will feel it ashemed bcz every one comming out from outlet will.look like did no shopping or having other bags in their hands will definitely effect their rapport.
Its not the matther of 30rs but if we are paying thousands they can give these bags free which actually cost them 5 to 10rs maximum. Even they are earning 10 to 20rs each bag from us.
Please make yourself aware of concept of sustainability. Carry a bag with you while you are shopping how hard is that. It makes me wonder why posts like this get approved
I visited turkey that time I didn‚Äôt know if to purchase a bag for grocery I and my aunt visited vegetable shop then after buying we went to the counter she asked if we need kosher in turkey it‚Äôs called a bag we see each other strangely üòÇ but later we were embarrassed as we didn‚Äôt have knew so it‚Äôs common in western world
These so called highfy brands pretend to be customer oriented. But eventually they can't leave 30 Rupees bag free for their own customers. Hypocrisy
It's not just khaddi every big and small brand is charging for a bag.
You‚Äôre late to the party. They haven‚Äôt now started charging. It‚Äôs been a while.
Also just stop expecting free bags. Nothing in life is free‚Ä¶
Such posts should be banned.
That‚Äôs how it is all over the world
It's not fair at all!
Sapphire also doing this pathetic quality paper bag which can't even bear weight of the product..and charging rs 20 for that with their logo print on it
Keep one cloth bag in your bag.
The quality is pathetic 2 se zyada suit usme rakho to phat jata he so better to carry your own either way it's not even reusable akhir me phenkna hi perta he.
Now every one is charging on the name of GST Tax and Sales Tax not only Khaadi
"Hasn't this topic been discussed enough on this forum? ü§î Khaadi, Hush Puppies etc"
"Please take your own reusable cloth bags,like many of us, if you don't want to pay Rs 30 extra."
"Next time, keep your own shopping bag with you.."
Don't waste your money on these brands
Take your own cloths bag. Say no to plastic and paper bag to control pollution and to save trees.
"Generation is giving cloth bag free cost with every purchase , why a big brand like can't do this , khaadi start giving cloth bags show some generosity"
#charge for paper bags üò°
What are the behaviors of all such brands like Sapphire  Khaadi Crossstitch.pk Limelight  and other brands. we pay high amount of bill they infact charged us all huge taxes but no such paper bag provide to us  üõç  Means we go other place to carry all stuff in hand..
Dear all fellows Kindly take serious action against this üôÑüò° if they are in the line of cost cutting so why we pay for bag? #Boycott
"If you can afford to buy from such brands, you can also afford a 20rs paper bag. Or you can bring your own reusable bag from home. This is a common practice in majority of the countries outside Pakistan."
They are trying to eliminate single use plastic waste and frankly Pakistan can benefit from it.
It‚Äôs 2024 and not everything needs to be boycotted.
"Just pick up random things make around 70,000 ka bill and when they ask u want to buy bag .. ask why i pay for bag.. he will give his explanation.. u say leave it not buying anything and walk away... Har koi yeh keray ga they will think they are losing customers! üòé"
"I have stopped taking their bags and carry my own. Even if they want to charge for the paper bags, but then they should not have their brand logo /name printed on it. Why should we be carrying their bags (for advertisement/marketing), which we have paid for ?"
I mean we pay for paper bags outside of Pakistan as well. In Europe and middle east (some shops are now charging). Yaha to per paper bag ‚Ç¨0.25 cents (75 rupees) and ‚Ç¨0.95 cents (288 pkr) for khaadi sized bag.
Best way is to carry paper bags when shopping (keep them in your car all time)
Nothing comes for free remember
Soon they will charge you for visiting in their stores and breathing in there.
Why don't you carry a bag with you?
Thats how it is all around the world. Glad to see pakistan catch up.
"It reduces plastic and paper waste, also encourages people to carry their own reusable bags."
"If they want to charge for the paper bags, but then they should not have their brand logo printed on it. Why should we carry their bags for advertising or marketing"
Its simple Take your reusable bag everytime when you go to shopping.
"Paying for the bag is just okay, but if there is branding on the bag then I am never going to purchase it for their free marketing... if the salesman or cashier forces you to buy the bag then you can complain it against Consumers' court, they will be fined minimum 25K Rs. for sure."
"There is nothing wrong with paying for paper bags. No one is forcing you to shop from them. If you don't want to pay, simply bring your own bag"
Because they are promoting reusable bags. Take your bag with you. Simple.
Canada banned single use bags 2 years ago. Why cant you just accept the change.
I am glad Pakistan is catching up.
"Before anyone comment here that, brands charge you outside of Pakistan anywhere. Doesn't mean if it's common it's right."
yeah its such a cheap thing to do honestly hazaaro rupay de do for sub standard clothes aur uper say 20rs bag kay alag say do it should be free like it use to be back in the good ol days
"Everyone should give free paper bags or increase their product prices to incorporate for their expense of the bags. So this way, the customers won't be angry as the bag price will be incorporated in the product price."
This is to discourage the extravagant use of bags.
Faizan Nafees sir plz beg/Shopper Kay charges khatam karden plz
Aur agar ham 10 k 15k 20k tak ke shopping kar saktay hain tu ye log aik bag kiu nahi day saktay .shopper tu agar 12 kenoo lain tu fruit wala bhi free day dayta hay .
Aur agar shopper buy karna he hay tu in k naam ka permotion kiu karain haam logg.
We should buy plain shopper without any printed brand names on it .
Paying/charging for paper bags is actually a ploy to encourage re use.
Simply don't buy their bag and they will stop this practice in our part of the region. Carry your own cloth bag secondly it's customers choice if they pay for things in thousands but it's not interested in buying their Kraft paper bags
"Only difference is pk mai usually they don't ask customer to buy bags , they add in bill by themselves , unlike other countries every time they ask , fo you want to buy a bag"
"Such A Repetitive ""Concern"" By Now. Considering You Didn't Boycott When Others Were Complaining, More Won't Boycott Now Either"
Stop buying shopping bags from them.
"Big brands in Pakistan looting people as the cost of their products is very, very high. It's a question if their products are expensive than why they charge for bags. Simply they can adjust in their cost secretly and stop this debate."
"People pay for Paper Bags in the entire world. Some countries implement this a rule. By making customers pay for bags so to reduce waste and be more sustainable in the long run. Sometimes it boils down to the brand itself, some brands provide free bags, others dont."
"However, if it was any country other than Pakistan, It wouldve been alright. Pakistani clothing brands are doing it just to earn an extra buck, they dont give a flying _ about sustainability or quality. All they stand for is money. So they should definitely provide free bags at least for their subpar disposable products."
"Meri suggestion hai sab bajis ko, baba Sapphire k astana shareef pe jana chor den. üåö"
Yeah boycott because that‚Äôs the only solution
Saba AlamThis issue is addressed again and again and still not resolved.
It‚Äôs very common around the world. Just came back from Europe so my sister always carry a fabric bag with her if going for shopping.
Why can‚Äôt we Pakistanis do that instead of always complaining here. We don‚Äôt want to do anything by ourselves. Always wait for others to take a step. So sad üòû
Kuch tu acha kar lein for our country.
"Take your own bags please, the brand hasn't forced you to buy from them."
I live abroad and I pay for my bags even in small grocery shops. It's eco-friendly.
Nothing unusual. Happens in abroad as well. I have seen brands doing this in UK
I have started carrying cloth bags given by khaadi. It's easily foldable
"I have started bringing my own bag. Means purchased from metro, imtiaz etc once n using same for grocery shopping and other shopping from mall. It has now become a habit of us to keep the bags in car all the time."
I always Carry a basket with me for everything.
Pay for the bag but not for there advertisment.
And I don't get it why people don't take there bags along with them.
No one thinks that u r kanjoos. Every one should take this step to avoid there brand advertisment.
Seriously entitled attitude of our awam and voice of customer posting it everytime
"i don't buy their bags, its such a shame they own huge outlets and are charging for paper bags"
And we are advertising them by carrying the paid bag. What a marketing strategy
"An other day , an other paper related bags query.. wise decision is "" carry your own bags "" that's the only thing which is gonna workout."
"It‚Äôs insane how people are still coming up with the same tired argument for paper bags - no, you are not ‚Äòfreely promoting‚Äô a business by buying their paper bags with their logo on it. People do not see you with a paper bag sporting a brands logo and assume you‚Äôre a walking advertisement."
"The fact of the matter is that plastic bags need to be limited, only used where necessary and they‚Äôre not necessary for shopping. Paper bags or cloth bags require more money for production, hence the surcharge of 10-50 Rupees."
"All that aside, if the argument‚Äôs that why should you pay that amount at all - then don‚Äôt? There‚Äôs always a quick fix to not wanting to pay an amount for something you don‚Äôt feel is just or necessary. We‚Äôre just so used to arguing with shopkeepers that we believe we can argue our way into anything."
"If you don‚Äôt like the price, walk away. Also, in the grand scheme of things, you need to be able to practice sustainability. That is, get a tote bag or a cloth bag and take it with you when you shop. Take 3-4 they literally take up no space and it‚Äôs incredibly efficient."
Please stop living in this dystopian world where everyone has to bend to your will. Grow up.
This is normal anywhere in the world grow up
"Masla yehi hai k yaha koi bolta nahi..I often have arguments with these brands, and the salesman is like"" muh latka huwa"" ...I knw he is the bechara ,jo pech Mai phas jata hai.."
"If you can afford to buy from such brands, you can also afford a 20rs paper bag. Or you can bring your own reusable bag from home."
They are trying to eliminate single use plastic waste and frankly Pakistan can benefit from it.
It‚Äôs 2024 and not everything needs to be boycotted.
Plastic bags should be discouraged. Reusable paper bags can be carried with us now.
I agree. Nudure also do same thing.
"simple rule,bring ur own bag from home.i always do this & never face any issue"
Yes sapphire khaadi are owned by McDonalds so boycott
"Boycott all the brands .. don't wear clothes ... I mean branded clothes.. go to ashiayana , jama or Tariq road,, Pathan theli me kaprre daal k dega without any extra charge .. ap bhi Khush rahain gi or Hum ko ye 4 4 aane wali posts bhi nai dekhni parain gi"
Technically they don't charge you tax. It goes to government.
Brands must pay for the bags by themselves they can easily afford 30rs from their gross profits
The reason for them to pay is their branding on the bad
People spent a lot of money in advertisement and they are getting it only in 30rs per bag ü§ù
Ohh please if you can afford 3k to 10k per dress you can afford a 100rs paper bag this is not something to brag about here and if you don't want to pay just carry your tote bag with yourself don't use this platform for your useless complains
Pori dunya me hota it‚Äôs not in Pakistan only simply don‚Äôt buy it
I am so against of this thing why are they selling their brand name bags if you people charging then send give printe gift bags why should we promote your brands üò°üòí
I support any kind of initiative which makes people pay for the garbage they create and which leads towards sustainability
Charged me with 40/ per bag.
If you can't afforrd a paper bag you should not buy these stuff tbh
"It is the worldwide policy now to ensure the use of fabric bags instead of plastic/paper bags, customers should research before visiting brands for the first time..."
"They are offering you if you don't want their bag carry your own, if they force you tou buy then you can claim them wrong..."
Oh and not only that they don‚Äôt even return change.. saying they don‚Äôt have it. Al karam Emporium mall cashier refused to give me Rs 15 back but did charge me for the bag and card transaction. Makes you wonder.
50 thousand ki shopping kr atay . 20 rs k bag k peechay shor dala hua. Everything has a price. This rule is not only in pakistan.
I pay those brands in soiled 1rs coins.
"Free bag k Mazay srf pk mai hn , outside pakistan even groceries p bhi either purchase bag or take your own"
Don't take any bags from these blasters
Khaadi shame on you for having worker who joke about people‚Äôs weight. Today at Dolmen Mall a work woman had the audacity to joke about our weight when we asked for XL size which was clearly mentioned on the tag. the girl said the tag says XL but we do not make it in western clothes. While my friend and I rant to one another about what should we do. She said ‚Äúshould lose weight‚Äù.
Sad part is a person working in a women outlet had the audacity to body shame. We are living in 2022! What the actual fuck?
I am someone who delivered a baby 8 months ago and it‚Äôs already hard to cope up with body weight. this just triggered me.
Being someone who always took a stand for wrong things.. this wasn‚Äôt okay at all. A big shame on Khaadi for not training their workers.
When I complaint about this to the manager she said ‚ÄúI was just joking to your friend‚Äù. Why? Did we know each other that gave her the right to joke?
A sorry doesn‚Äôt help when this kind of attitude is shown. These kind of jokes on body shaming aren‚Äôt okay at all!
"This post is to inform anyone who is a bigger size, think again before walking in at Khaadi!"
"The behavior was non professional, but she did apologise? If yes then u should be the bigger person & let it go after complaining to the senior staff ... dont make it into one of those incidents where a woman can call anyone uncle , but god forbid if anyone calls a woman ""Aunty"""
"Body shaming is a western term and it only circulates in the burger class of Pak. Sales staff generally comes from lower middle class and less educated background. I am very sure she only said that on a lighter note and didn't mean to offend or insult. You made a complaint to the Manager, I think she would have learned the lesson. Let's move on now."
"thats not khaadi's fault its individual fault if she/he is body shaming, most of the time i dont get my desire size at outlets so its common because not every person needs XL size"
"Louder for the people at the back... Saying sorry does not validate anything, it doesn't fix your shitty mindset!"
"This is not okay, I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through this. Khaadi please do a better job at training your employees."
While I agree she was 100% wrong. I don't think you should Shame the brand
Just needs to be brought to their notice so they can take necessary action
Name and shame such shallow people who are working to support their family but cannot learn the manners to earn respect. Shame on her.
"Just reflects on that woman's upbringing and Khadi's lack of Code of Conduct, training, personal/professional grooming of their employees. In my entire career, the first orientation given by any new company I've joined, HR would conduct the code of conduct/ethics, personal and professional DOs and DON'Ts etc etc. This leaves a big question mark on Khadi's management and their lack of employee grooming. Especially customer facing, front end staff."
"You were kind enough to let her off with just a few words and this post. She should be fired on the spot and learn a lesson from what NEVER TO DO. If she's working to support herself or her family, then she should've been all the more cautious of how difficult these current trying times and the job market is."
"God, ITS not hard to learn to be professional no matter where you come from. It goes unstated that you are NOT supposed to comment unnecessarily... I mean okay she doesn't see anything wrong with body shaming because of the society and all sorts of victim blaming people will show up and justify what she said AS A JOKE which IS TERRIBLE BUT professionalism is not that DIFFICULT to understand."
Who is she to joke even? Shame on them. Most of them are always busy in chit chat with male employes there.
It‚Äôs basic decency ! So many brands have this issue .EGO esp Sindhi Muslim has zero professionalism & customer service etiquette ! They need to change the entire staff or do away with the branch
"Dear what so ever the situation ur in means a new mom ,she dosnt have the right to talk like this,highly unprofessional nd unethical ."
"Wow, incredibly ugly behaviour. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through this"
I live in Canada. There is zero tolerance for such a behaviour. The sales person would be fired for just cause on the spot. In Pakistan there are absolutely no sales skills as no one bothers to train the sales person. They are hired mostly based on their looks ( especially girls) so that they can attract customers using their figure and gestures. Shameful but true. There may be a few exceptions.
"I was recently watching a pakistani home based woman‚Äôs facebook live selling show and when asked for a bigger size she said gym jayein! I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt give it to her then & there, so unlike me. Point being, pakistani women are so weight obsessed they throw unsolicited advice like confetti!!! It‚Äôs disgusting how being in shape matters to them for all the wrong reasons and they think being plus size means humein gym ka concept he nahi pata hoga and all our lives we were waiting for their advice ke ek din ye advice dengi or hum patle hojayenge. I can too easily pick on them, their skin, their dressing sense, their hair, a million other things! But I choose not too cuz every individual is unique and my upbringing doesn‚Äôt teach me to judge and comment on others. I don‚Äôt understand what gives them the right & authority to comment on anyone else‚Äôs?!!"
Wow this is SO MESSED UP Khaadi
"These are western chonchlay. In Pakistan, kala, mota, githa, lumba, single pasli are common and people don't feel offended hence the sales girl and her response"
"She apologised & If this still triggers you, it means you are not comfortable in your skin. So stop blaming other for your insecurities"
I believe this is khaadi‚Äôs fault. They should train their workers about such social aspects.
"It‚Äôs okay, go lose some weight. You‚Äôll be healthy"
"Never call a Woman 'Aunty' and never talk about her weight. Even if she asks if you think she is fat, change the topic. A 'Yes' will get you murdered, a 'No' will get you accused of being a liar."
"I just hope we stick to fat shaming and keep fighting over it and don't end up seeing posts where people go into a store and want to use the ladies washroom because they 'identify as a woman' even if they are men, and the store refused!"
I dont know what wrong with people why they are so toxic
"Khaadi team, need your attention to this please!"
Proper response should've been given
shame them on LinkedIn as well.
People are inhuman and lack empathy
Basic decency is what most Pakistanis will never have
"It's an appreciation post for Bonanza Satrangi and at the same time I want to highlight one of the issue with other brands. Today, I went to Lucky one and first bought a dress from Khaadi and on purchasing a dress of 4k they told me that you cannot have a bag for it instead you have to pay RS. 30 for Khaadi paper bag to carry the dress."
Then I went to Bonanza Satrangi and bought another dress worth around 3k and they gave it properly in Bonanza printed paper bag without charging anything for it.
First I want to applaud Bonanza Satrangi  for maintaining their standards whereas here I want to highlight that this is a very wrong custom adopted by these brands that they have started charging their branding bags. If a person buys a 10 rupee coriander even that man gives you a free bag to carry the vegetable. And then comes these big names!! People buy really expensive things from them and they cannot even give a bag. What a shame on Khaadi and other brands like this!!
Keep in mind that when I highlighted this issue at Khaadi counter so they told me we have replaced the plastic bags with paper bag that is why we charge. But the point is that then offer a plain bag and then charge. Why should I or anybody else pay you for your branding!!
I really appreciate Bonanza Satrangi. You didn't only won the customer but you showed who is the true brand.
"Bonanza Satrangi Definitely Included The Cost Of The Bag In The Dress's Price. Nothing Is ""Free""."
"NoBi every industry decide the price of the product after costing. This is a basic business rule to calculate the cost of each and every thing and then finalize the price of the product. So this does not justify Khaadi or other brands to charge their paper bags. Moreover, if they really want to contribute to environment and bring a change so they can simply give a plain paper bag and charge for it, why to sell their own branding bags."
someone are charging and someone included in their prices
"Samia Saeed every industry be it textile be it food or what so ever, all decide the price of the product after costing. This is a basic business rule to calculate the cost of each and every thing and then finalize the price of the product. So this does not justify Khaadi or other brands to charge their paper bags. Moreover, if they really want to contribute to environment and bring a change so they can simply give a plain paper bag and charge for it, why to sell their own branding bags."
so happy to see your post .experienced the same issue with all brands and registered my complaint for carrying their publicity bags after buying the bag
Fariha Shehzad you just spoke out my feelings!
A BIG no to Sapphire and all those brands who take price of their shopping bags :
A worth-reading message posted on Sapphire website:
What an excellent gesture from your outlet at Dolmen Mall Tariq Road Karachi. Totally disappointed and will never ever go for a shopping at any of your brand store.
"Why you people are so curious for money? Are your profits are not so enough to cover the cost of shopping bags? And that shopping bag have your brand printed which you are forcefully selling to your customers, looks very strange that you're promoting your brand at the price stolen from customers."
"For god sake, you people must understand the meaning of courtesy."
I have returned the bag at your counter and took the suites in hands just to record my disappointment. If your mentality is so cheap to take the cost of bags from customers then you should have some courage to supply such bags without your logo.
Branded bags should be free.
"Normal bags should be charged, if they must be."
"I have been saying this for so long about bata, imtiaz and other outlets. why should we pay for their brand advertisement?"
Let's carry fabric bags in our purses
