The only drawback is that it doesn‚Äôt have a zipper. I‚Äôd say charge 50 rs more but add a zipper,Neutral,2
Memon Reema love the zip idea üí°,Positive,0
But they should not write their brand name if we are paying for the bag,Neutral,2
Nadia Shamim well if you are paying 200 or plus then Consider it as a product,Positive,0
i will share my experience. theres a local departmental store here in my area who charge for bags. once i forgot to take my own bags. the bill was paid via card. after charging the amount he asked madam apko bag b chahye tha. i said ji chahye. he said oho me ne bill kar dia hay ap cash day dain 30. i said i dont have any cash with me. guess what. he took out a shiny plastic bag hidden under the billing counter. those free ones we used to get. so i said bhai zara do aur nikal dain alag alag dalain chezain jis tarah alag alag bags k charge kar k ap alag alag pack kartay hain. and he did that without a word.,Neutral,2
Naila Aman are you talking about imtiaz? because they did not even bother to hide the shoppers. rather they were hanging right next to the counter. i too asked the person on duty if we can just keep the stuff in it than purchasing another bag. he refused and spoke gibberishüòÇ couldn‚Äôt understand what he said lol,Neutral,2
Kashaf Amjad not imtiaz. it was Rahim Store,Positive,0
There are some selected clothes that comes with a fabric bag on khaadi. You can check that online too.,Positive,0

Sapphire has been giving cloth bags FOC for every order,Neutral,2
Paper bags comes from trees .. for that they have to cut trees. First everyone stopped paper bags because they were not environment friendly. Now again shifting to paper bags because that is environment friendly.. its all a hoax of the capitalist world.. treating us like pawns in their greed for more expenditure. Sab milke hum ko ulo bana rahe hain.,Negative,1
So abroad you pay so that you know that next time you go somewhere you take the same bag.. the entire point of paying for extra shopping bag is to reuse and abuse,Neutral,2
i bought some suits from khaadi few months back. they gave me a paper bag and charged me for that bag but on our way to our car tha bag broke and all the suits were on road. i dont know why are they doing this and how much more money they will earn from this garbage bag.,Neutral,2
You‚Äôre right recently I ordered from khaddi and got it delivered with cloth bag instead of plastic bag. And when I ordered from al karam they delivered in plastic bag,Neutral,2
Firstly Limelight interduce these bags,Neutral,2
What are they charging for this carry bag,Neutral,2
Hammad Asghar put this as illustration in my dissertation,Positive,0
Simply .. Khaadi has started doing business using the useless rags üòÜ,Neutral,2
That‚Äôs the trend that should be followed if we really wanna reduce use of plastic.. ub wo khaadi ho ya koi bh brand..,Neutral,2

"I see people saying ""If you are paying for a suit at khaadi then why are they branding it?""",Neutral,2
"Wrong! Khadi sells suits, it is not a shopping bags selling store. Customers should have the option of buying the 10 rupees non branded bags imo.",Neutral,2
Take your own bag and dont pay for Khaadi bags. Simple.,Positive,0
Its happening poori dunya mai I guess,Positive,0
This happens everywhere in the world,Positive,0
I have seen worst quality bags than Khaadi being sold by brands and local shops. It is a way to stop wastage and maybe make some extra money on the side!,Positive,0
You can bring or purchase your own white bag and put your purchased items in that... There is nothing wrong in charging for the bags whether they are branded or non branded,Neutral,2
Carrefour also charges for their bags,Neutral,2
"The purpose of charging for the bags is to reduce waste. They‚Äôre selling cloth bags for 200 pkr so you can either get those or carry your own cloth bag next time you shop at Khaadi. Same as carrefour and miniso etc. You either buy a reusable cloth bag that‚Äôll last you months or any other cloth, paper or plastic bag from any brand honestly that you can use to save money and the environment!",Positive,0
"You are buying it from their shop, if you don‚Äôt want to roam with a logo then bring your own paper bags and get over it as soon as possible",Neutral,2
Daily some one cries on bags as if no other issue is left on planet .,Positive,0
Why its so difficult to bring your own bag when going to khaadi ?,Neutral,2

"Don't buy it, apna bag ghr se le k jayenü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Neutral,2
Like they are not forcing you to buy a bag. The same way they have khaadi written on their suits displayed in their outlets and its your choice buy them or not.,Positive,0
"So the idea is to discourage people from buying bags to reduce paper waste. And considering the current load on our landfills, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.",Neutral,2
"Also, they always ask at the counter if you want the bag to be added to the bill.",Neutral,2
"If anyone doesn't want to pay for the bag with Khaadi""s logo, don't buy it. Take your bag with you. Or if you've shopped from another brand , use their bag instead.",Neutral,2
It‚Äôs 50 for paper bag and for printed 150 in Islamabad.,Neutral,2

"I have seen multiple posts regarding paid bags in Pakistan. Mere Bhai, I have visited Europe, majoity brands either fashion store or Cash and carry charge for the bags and they charge for their own #branded bags and nobody ever complained there. They are happy to pay 10-20 cents for the branded bag. We are happy to buy the ""branded wallet and bags"" in thousands but unable to pay for a shopping bag of few cents.",Positive,0
Khaadi needs to focus on their fabric quality instead of doing nonsense harkaten!,Positive,0
"You were paying for it before as well, packaging cost is always added as a overhead while costing.",Neutral,2
Maybe they excluded that and made it optional for people to buy or not buy the bags?,Negative,1
Seriously who is letting this same issue being dragged for no good reason. If you have issue take bags from home and understand it‚Äôs their commodity they are selling their commodity they can put anything on it. They are giving you option to buy or not to buy.,Neutral,2
This group needs to change their names to whines of customer.,Positive,0

"Paying for these bags dosen't make sense. Khaddi should keep bio degradable bags, that is worth paying for and also serves the purpose to keep environment clean.",Neutral,2
Agreed. That is why i dont take publicity bags. Why should i market their brand for free.,Negative,1
"Indeed, I am in 101% agreement. They have to give it for free, even subsidies you for doing marketing for them",Neutral,2
"Take ur own cloth bag,reusable. Ppl all over the world do it. It's green and Davis nature. Start recy owing in pak,we need it so much. N y pay huge amounts to these brands for THELAS",Positive,0
I don't mind paying for a bag. But I don't like the idea of paying for marketing their brand.,Neutral,2
Sigh‚Ä¶not a day goes by we don‚Äôt get a post like this on this forum,Neutral,2
"True that ! That's why I stopped them immediately when they want to add shopping bag in the bill. When I as a customer paying for it I have every right to use it several times without being brand ambassador that too ""UNPAID ONE"" for later usage of the bag.",Neutral,2
It's just a sustainable movement where people are motivated to use reusable bag instead of buying a new bag everytime. In Scandinavia we're paying for bags for basic groceries too.,Neutral,2
Ok charge for bag but remove your logo and name from the bag Khaadi,Negative,1
"Agreed, refuse to take it, use your own shopper bagüòÑ tell them we don't want to pay for ur bag, if they insist then ask them to give it free, raise voice for ur rights, sirf idhar post daal kr koi faida nahi, ta phir khamoshi se pay karein",Positive,0
Oh my god all these people‚Ä¶. Bhaie sahab take ur own bag.,Positive,0
Or maybe read about why brands and companies are doing it. Climate change suna hai? GET ON WITH THE PROGRAM!,Positive,0
I agree to it.. why should pay for their bags and advertise their brand.. why should we pay for the bag with their brand name.. if they want to make money out of paper bags then these bags should not have their logo .. otherwise we should boycott buying these bags and we should bring own bag at such outlets.. it's not about paying 50 or 100 RS but agar hum isse tarah in chotay chotay isse ko nazar andaaz kartay rahienge to yeh brands isse tarah hamien loottay rahienge ..,Neutral,2
I don‚Äôt see the logic of such paper waste concept at all. Because if someone buying lot of stuff they will of-course pay for the bags too. Status conscious Ab bag bhi buy karke showoff karenge üòÇ,Positive,0

"I think that's totally fine ..in Germany & other countries they also charge for the bags (not all brands) , even in supermarkets they charge 20 or 50 cents.",Neutral,2
why are they giving their suits in plactic bags? They should stop that too or start charging those as well. Then we will take out the item from their printed plastic bag and put it in our own bag.,Neutral,2
"I wouldn‚Äôt think too much abt this, now that I am seeing another post on a similar issue.They are charging for the cost of the bag and I don‚Äôt always put Khaadi stuff when reusing it. It‚Äôs very subjective and petty.",Positive,0
Yeah so accurate why we pay them the cost for the bag? That is something which is totally wrong khaddi is just trying to pull out money from the Pocket of customers in any form.,Neutral,2
Agreed.printed bags are good to reuse but with khaadi logo it can't be...,Neutral,2
U can take your own bag.. simple.. obv they will promote their own brand... no brainer,Neutral,2

"Its very basic - charging for bags to reduce use and encourage reuse - why should they make bags on their pocket and not even print a logo of their own on it, while the clothes that would be carried in that bag are from that shop.

Oh and not only that they don‚Äôt even return change.. saying they don‚Äôt have it. Al karam Emporium mall cashier refused to give me Rs 15 back but did charge me for the bag and card transaction. Makes you wonder.,Positive,0

Khaadi shame on you for having worker who joke about people‚Äôs weight. Today at Dolmen Mall a work woman had the audacity to joke about our weight when we asked for XL size which was clearly mentioned on the tag. the girl said the tag says XL but we do not make it in western clothes. While my friend and I rant to one another about what should we do. She said ‚Äúshould lose weight‚Äù.,Neutral,2
Sad part is a person working in a women outlet had the audacity to body shame. We are living in 2022! What the actual fuck?,Negative,1
I am someone who delivered a baby 8 months ago and it‚Äôs already hard to cope up with body weight. this just triggered me.,Neutral,2
Being someone who always took a stand for wrong things.. this wasn‚Äôt okay at all. A big shame on Khaadi for not training their workers.,Neutral,2
When I complaint about this to the manager she said ‚ÄúI was just joking to your friend‚Äù. Why? Did we know each other that gave her the right to joke?,Question,4
A sorry doesn‚Äôt help when this kind of attitude is shown. These kind of jokes on body shaming aren‚Äôt okay at all!,Positive,0
"This post is to inform anyone who is a bigger size, think again before walking in at Khaadi!",Positive,0
"The behavior was non professional, but she did apologise? If yes then u should be the bigger person & let it go after complaining to the senior staff ... dont make it into one of those incidents where a woman can call anyone uncle , but god forbid if anyone calls a woman ""Aunty""",Neutral,2
"Body shaming is a western term and it only circulates in the burger class of Pak. Sales staff generally comes from lower middle class and less educated background. I am very sure she only said that on a lighter note and didn't mean to offend or insult. You made a complaint to the Manager, I think she would have learned the lesson. Let's move on now.",Neutral,2
"thats not khaadi's fault its individual fault if she/he is body shaming, most of the time i dont get my desire size at outlets so its common because not every person needs XL size",Neutral,2

Just needs to be brought to their notice so they can take necessary action,Positive,0
Name and shame such shallow people who are working to support their family but cannot learn the manners to earn respect. Shame on her.,Positive,0
"Just reflects on that woman's upbringing and Khadi's lack of Code of Conduct, training, personal/professional grooming of their employees. In my entire career, the first orientation given by any new company I've joined, HR would conduct the code of conduct/ethics, personal and professional DOs and DON'Ts etc etc. This leaves a big question mark on Khadi's management and their lack of employee grooming. Especially customer facing, front end staff.",Neutral,2
"You were kind enough to let her off with just a few words and this post. She should be fired on the spot and learn a lesson from what NEVER TO DO. If she's working to support herself or her family, then she should've been all the more cautious of how difficult these current trying times and the job market is.",Negative,1
"God, ITS not hard to learn to be professional no matter where you come from. It goes unstated that you are NOT supposed to comment unnecessarily... I mean okay she doesn't see anything wrong with body shaming because of the society and all sorts of victim blaming people will show up and justify what she said AS A JOKE which IS TERRIBLE BUT professionalism is not that DIFFICULT to understand.",Positive,0
Who is she to joke even? Shame on them. Most of them are always busy in chit chat with male employes there.,Neutral,2

"Wow, incredibly ugly behaviour. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through this",Neutral,2
I live in Canada. There is zero tolerance for such a behaviour. The sales person would be fired for just cause on the spot. In Pakistan there are absolutely no sales skills as no one bothers to train the sales person. They are hired mostly based on their looks ( especially girls) so that they can attract customers using their figure and gestures. Shameful but true. There may be a few exceptions.,Neutral,2
"I was recently watching a pakistani home based woman‚Äôs facebook live selling show and when asked for a bigger size she said gym jayein! I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt give it to her then & there, so unlike me. Point being, pakistani women are so weight obsessed they throw unsolicited advice like confetti!!! It‚Äôs disgusting how being in shape matters to them for all the wrong reasons and they think being plus size means humein gym ka concept he nahi pata hoga and all our lives we were waiting for their advice ke ek din ye advice dengi or hum patle hojayenge. I can too easily pick on them, their skin, their dressing sense, their hair, a million other things! But I choose not too cuz every individual is unique and my upbringing doesn‚Äôt teach me to judge and comment on others. I don‚Äôt understand what gives them the right & authority to comment on anyone else‚Äôs?!!",Positive,0

"It's an appreciation post for Bonanza Satrangi and at the same time I want to highlight one of the issue with other brands. Today, I went to Lucky one and first bought a dress from Khaadi and on purchasing a dress of 4k they told me that you cannot have a bag for it instead you have to pay RS. 30 for Khaadi paper bag to carry the dress.",Positive,0
Then I went to Bonanza Satrangi and bought another dress worth around 3k and they gave it properly in Bonanza printed paper bag without charging anything for it.,Positive,0
First I want to applaud Bonanza Satrangi  for maintaining their standards whereas here I want to highlight that this is a very wrong custom adopted by these brands that they have started charging their branding bags. If a person buys a 10 rupee coriander even that man gives you a free bag to carry the vegetable. And then comes these big names!! People buy really expensive things from them and they cannot even give a bag. What a shame on Khaadi and other brands like this!!,Positive,0
Keep in mind that when I highlighted this issue at Khaadi counter so they told me we have replaced the plastic bags with paper bag that is why we charge. But the point is that then offer a plain bag and then charge. Why should I or anybody else pay you for your branding!!,Positive,0
I really appreciate Bonanza Satrangi. You didn't only won the customer but you showed who is the true brand.,Positive,0

"NoBi every industry decide the price of the product after costing. This is a basic business rule to calculate the cost of each and every thing and then finalize the price of the product.
